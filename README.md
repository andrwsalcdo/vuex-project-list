# vuex-project-list

A Medium blog post [Vue + Vuex - Getting Started](https://medium.com/@bradfmd/vue-vuex-getting-started-f78c03d9f65)

The idea was to create a project list app using vuex. However the post retrieved data via Axios, although, I did not continue with actually retriving sample data. 
I felt it beyond the scope of this tutorial. I instead focused on Vuex and how it works conceptually as a state management pattern. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
